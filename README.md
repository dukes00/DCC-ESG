# DCC-ESG

These two scripts and time series located in the 'data' folder were described in a paper I co-authored - "Risk management opportunities between socially responsible investments and selected commodities".

In order to reproduce the results you need to first run the 'resampling.R' script with functions defined in it.
Then the report script can be rendered into HTML/PDF/DOCX - see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ on how to do that.
